* Slider 
* Must be able to save the current work and load saved work

### Should

* Ability to split segments
* Ability to modify segments in annotation mode
* Pop-out media player

* Variable color themes
* Possible to do annotations on multiple tiers at the same time 
* Change the order of tiers
