## Annotation Application
The purpose is to create a cross-platform application for making annotations on video files. It will be based on our experience of using Elan software for annotating video files.

### Development tools
* Visual Studio Code
* PyCharm
* code_together
* Liveshare
* GitHub
* Google Drive
* Python 3.9
* PyQT5 or Pyside2
* QtCreator

## Planned and Wished for Features

### Shall

* It must be possible to load at least one video format in the application
* It must be possible to create at least one tier for annotations
* It must be possible to make segments
* Must be able to make annotations
* Video must be able to play/pause/reverse
* Slider 
* Must be able to save the current work and load saved work

### Should

* Ability to split segments
* Ability to modify segments in annotation mode
* Pop-out media player
* Variable playback-speed
* Audio-activity bar
* Variable color themes
* Possible to do annotations on multiple tiers at the same time 
* Change the order of tiers
* Tier hierarchy
* Zoom in/out segment widget

### Dreams Beyond
