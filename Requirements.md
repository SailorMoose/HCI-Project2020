### QtAV

If you choose to build, make sure to build in the project enviroment through pipenv shell
I'd also recommend building using "make INSTALL_ROOT="Easy/To/Remember/Path" -j2 install" for easier acces to the files

Regardless of how you install it, Copy or link the files in the lib folder to enviroment/root/path/lib/python3.9/site-packages/PyQt5/Qt
Example for linux $HOME/.local/share/virtualenvs/HCI-Project-ofgc_U_d/lib/python3/site-packages/PyQt5/Qt
